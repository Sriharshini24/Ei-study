Design Patterns and Task Management System - README
Overview
This repository contains Java implementations of various software design patterns and a task management system for organizing daily schedules.

Exercise 1 - Design Patterns
Behavioral Design Patterns

Command Pattern (Smart Home System): Control devices like lights using commands.

Run: Execute SmartHomeCommandDemo.java.
Example: Light is turned ON/OFF.
Observer Pattern (Stock Market): Traders get notified when stock prices change.

Run: Execute StockMarketDemo.java.
Example: Traders notified of price changes.
Creational Design Patterns

Singleton Pattern (Database Connection): Ensures one database connection throughout the app.

Run: Execute SingletonDemo.java.
Example: "Connected to the database."
Factory Method Pattern (Vehicle Manufacturing): Create different vehicles without exposing creation logic.

Run: Execute VehicleManufacturingDemo.java.
Example: "Manufactured: Car."
Structural Design Patterns

Composite Pattern (File System): Create a file system with files and folders.

Run: Execute FileSystemCompositeDemo.java.
Example: Shows the structure of files and folders.
Adapter Pattern (Payment System): Integrate new payment methods easily.

Run: Execute PaymentAdapterDemo.java.
Example: "Processing payment through PayPal."








Exercise 2 - Astronaut Daily Schedule Organizer
This is a console app to manage tasks with the following features:

Add tasks with descriptions, times, and priorities.
Remove tasks by description.
Mark tasks as completed.
View tasks or filter by priority.
Conflict detection when adding tasks.
To Run:
Execute AstronautDailyScheduleOrganizer.java.
Example Interaction:
mathematica
Copy code
1. Add Task
2. Remove Task
3. View All Tasks
Enter your choice: 1
Enter task description: Morning Exercise
Enter start time (HH:mm): 08:00
Enter end time (HH:mm): 09:00
Enter priority (Low/Medium/High): High
Instructions
Make sure you have Java 8 or later installed.
Compile the code using:
mathematica
Copy code
javac <FileName>.java
Run the compiled code with:
mathematica
Copy code
java <FileName>
Conclusion
These codes demonstrate how to apply different design patterns to solve common problems and manage daily tasks effectively.
