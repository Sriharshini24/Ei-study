Controlling a 6-Degree-of-Freedom (6-DoF) robotic manipulator presents significant challenges due to the high complexity and nonlinearity of the system. Traditional methods, such as inverse kinematics and classical control algorithms, often struggle to achieve precise and adaptive control in dynamic and unpredictable environments. This research explores the use of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to develop a robust control strategy for the manipulator. By leveraging DRL, the system can autonomously learn optimal control policies through interactions with its environment. The DRL agent is trained to accurately drive the robotic manipulator to desired target positions while handling a variety of environmental factors and constraints. The proposed approach aims to enhance performance and precision over conventional methods, with potential applications in industrial automation, precision assembly, and medical robotics. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the DRL-based strategy in achieving reliable control with improved accuracy across diverse operational scenarios.
